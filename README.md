## 🔒 Security

- API keys are handled securely through environment variables
- File processing is done locally without external uploads
- Chat history remains on your local session

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Invalid API key" error**
   - Verify your OpenAI API key is correct
   - Check that the environment variable is set properly

2. **File processing errors**
   - Ensure files are not corrupted
   - Check file size limits (recommended < 10MB)

3. **Slow performance**
   - Large files may take time to process
   - Consider reducing file sizes for faster analysis
