# OpenAI API Quota Solution Guide

## The Issue
Your OpenAI API key has exceeded its usage quota. This is a billing limitation, not a technical problem with the chatbot application.

## Immediate Solutions

### 1. Check Your OpenAI Account Status
- Visit: https://platform.openai.com/account/billing
- Review current usage and spending limits
- Verify payment method is active

### 2. Resolve Quota Issues
**Option A: Add/Update Payment Method**
- Go to billing settings
- Add valid credit card or payment method
- Increase monthly spending limit

**Option B: Upgrade Your Plan**
- Consider OpenAI Plus or Pay-as-you-go
- Higher quotas and better rate limits
- More reliable access to GPT-4o

**Option C: Wait for Reset**
- Free tier quotas reset monthly
- Check your reset date in the dashboard

### 3. Monitor Usage Going Forward
- Set up usage alerts in OpenAI dashboard
- Track API consumption regularly
- Use appropriate models for different tasks

## Application Status
The AI ChatBot Pro application is fully functional. The enhanced version now includes:

- Intelligent quota error handling
- Detailed error messages with solutions
- File analysis that works independently of AI chat
- Usage monitoring tools in the sidebar
- Direct links to OpenAI management pages

## Testing Without AI Chat
Even with quota issues, you can still:
- Upload and analyze files (local processing)
- View file statistics and previews
- Export previous chat conversations
- Use the colorful interface and features

## Alternative Approaches
1. **Use Different API Key**: If you have another OpenAI account
2. **Try Other AI Services**: Anthropic Claude, Google Gemini
3. **Local Processing**: File analysis continues to work

The application gracefully handles quota errors and provides helpful guidance for resolution.
